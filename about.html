                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>I am currently a Lecturer in Computing at the University of South Wales, where I teach modules including Operating Systems, Advanced Databases and Modelling, and Cyber Security. My role combines teaching, curriculum development, and guiding students on practical and research projects, ensuring they gain both theoretical foundations and hands-on skills.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I graduated from the University of South Wales with a First-Class Honours degree in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). My academic journey gave me a strong grounding in computer science, software engineering, and applied technologies, which I now bring into my teaching and project work.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>I have worked on a variety of applied computing projects that blend systems engineering, IoT, and data analysis. One of my key initiatives involved deploying and managing a Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pi devices, using it both as a teaching tool and as a platform for lightweight IoT experimentation. I also designed and implemented an automated plant watering system, integrating sensors and control logic on Raspberry Pi to demonstrate practical IoT automation in everyday environments. Beyond IoT, I have contributed to environmental research through drone surveys in Iceland, where I applied photogrammetry techniques to process aerial imagery into accurate 3D models, supporting landscape analysis and data-driven insights.</p>

                <h2>Certifications</h2>
                <p>I am currently working towards completing my Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PgCertHE) at the University of South Wales, which is designed to enhance my professional practice as a lecturer and academic. This qualification has given me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of teaching theory, curriculum design, and student engagement strategies, while reflecting critically on my own teaching methods. The PgCertHE also supports my pathway towards fellowship with the Higher Education Academy (HEA), further recognising my commitment to high-quality teaching and learning in higher education.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                <p>Outside of my teaching and professional work, I am passionate about all things computing and technology. I enjoy experimenting with Raspberry Pi devices, building small-scale systems, and exploring new ways of integrating IoT into everyday applications. My interests extend to programming and web development, where I continually explore new languages, frameworks, and approaches. I am also deeply engaged in GIS and remote sensing, particularly in the areas of 3D modelling, photogrammetry, and UAV-based surveys. Combining drones with computational modelling allows me to bring together my enthusiasm for data, technology, and the environment, often through hands-on projects that connect my academic interests with personal curiosity.</p>
